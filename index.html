     <a href="">Palantir Technologies</a>, Software Engineer

 </h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>
                    Solved critical performance problems on a major web product launch by optimizing the code and changing the UI to accomplish the same workflows without continual re-rendering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Solved the company-wide problem of many teams independently building seperate high-maintenance dataviz solutions by developing a single standardized, charting library. That library is Plottable.js (<a href="https://github.com/palantir/plottable">github</a>, <a href="http://plottablejs.org">site</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed Plottable from the <a href="https://github.com/palantir/plottable/commit/2854c7e61a816f457b1baef1e7bce60060777c00">first line of code</a> and served as tech lead as the team grew to 5 people. I made key architectural decisions, ramped up new engineers, set up infrastructure and tooling, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/palantir/plottable/graphs/contributors">a lot of code</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plottable is used throughout Palantir, continues to be under active development, and is one of the most-starred Typescript projects on Github. It was used to generate the GPA chart above.
                </li>
                In the tech talk below, given at <a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/">JSConf EU 2014</a>, I discuss Plottable and how it fits into the broader Javascript ecosystem.

 Research Assistant in Machine Learning<span>June - August 2012</span>
 </h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>
                    Worked with <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~risi/">Risi Kondor</a> at the <a href="http://ml.cs.uchicago.edu/">UChicago Machine Learning department</a> to implement the Hierarchical Bhattacharrya Kernel, a novel recursive similarity measure between trees of data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented the <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/papers/bhatta.pdf">Bhattacharrya Kernel</a>, a similarity measure between sets of data that operates by mapping datasets into an Hilbert spaces, fitting normal distributions to the data, and then computing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhattacharyya_distance">Bhattacharrya distance</a> between the distributions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recursively generalized the Bhattacharrya Kernel to operate on trees of sets of data, by using the Bhattacharrya Kernel as its own base kernel for comparisons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discovered and corrected several mathematical errrors in the original formulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The code (Matlab and Python) is <a href="https://github.com/danmane/Bhattacharrya"> on Github</a>.

                <li>Implemented a simple genetic model to have the bacteria mutate and evolve over time; each blob has a unique AI encoded as a simple neural network</li>

                    I'm an avid snowboarder, enthusiastic rock climber, and aspiring hang glider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've travelled extensively (over 45 countries); memorable experiences include a Mayan birthday party thrown in a rural Guatemalan farming village, yak tongue stew in the Mongolian desert, and thumb-wrestling with monk children in Tibet.
            </ul>
            I'm fascinated by building simulations of the world.
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>
                    One of the first programs I built was a simple physics simulator that modeled balls bouncing and colliding
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition to the EvolutionSimulator above, I also built a <a href="https://github.com/danmane/CellSim">simulation</a> of how complex multicellular behavior can arise from many individually dumb and ignorant cells running instances of the same "DNA" program. At one point, a bug in the DNA caused a certain cell type to replicate out of control, growing into a cancerous tumor on the side of the organism!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Someday, I want to build a simulator of an ecosystem from which interesting high-level interactions, e.g. parasitism and predation, naturally emerge.
