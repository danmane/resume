            <p>
                Plottable.js is a charting / data visualization library built on top of
                <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. It is <a href="http://www.palantir.com">Palantir</a>'s most prominent open-source project. It produces charts by combining small, modular components within a layout engine. Plottable is entirely in <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plottable is under active development by a team at Palantir, and is used in a variety of Palantir products. It is also one of the most-starred Typescript projects on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the tech lead on Plottable from Janurary 2014, when I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/palantir/plottable/commit/2854c7e61a816f457b1baef1e7bce60060777c00">first line of code</a> until November 2014, when I left Palantir. I was responsible for the architecture and many of the technical decisions. You can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A_FdbTkp9c">tech talk at JSConf EU</a> in which I describe the architecture and history of Plottable.

    </h3>
            <p>
                A web-based simulation of evolving bacteria-like organisms that simulates natural selection and evolution. Built as an art project using Processing.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                It uses web workers to run the simualtion model in a non-blocking fashion as a seperate process, and then passes model states to a renderer running on the main event loop. The front-end interpolates model updates so that even as the model slows down, the framerate remains constant. The blobs themselves have a simple genetic structure that encodes their properties and abilities, and a simple neural network that functions as an AI.

                <li>
                    Solved critical performance problems on a major web product launch, both by optimizing the code and changing the UI to accomplish the same workflows without CPU-intensive rendering.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Developed Plottable.js from scratch as an open source, first-class charting product to replace ad-hoc implementations across a variety of Palantir products. Led a team of 5 engineers and QE in building Plottable, which is now used across Palantir.

                    Worked with Professor Risi Kondor to implement the Hierarchical Bhattacharrya Kernel, a novel recursive similarity measure between trees of data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    First implemented the <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/papers/bhatta.pdf">Bhattacharrya Kernel</a>, a similarity measure between sets of data that operates by mapping datasets into an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, fitting normal distributions to the data, and then computing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhattacharyya_distance">Bhattacharrya distance</a> between the distributions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then recursively generalized the Bhattacharrya Kernel to operate on trees of sets of data, by using the Bhattacharrya Kernel as its own base kernel for comparisons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Over the course of the project, I discovered and corrected several mathematical errrors in the original formulation. The code (Matlab and Python) can be found <a href="https://github.com/danmane/Bhattacharrya"> on Github</a>.

                            The first thing I did when I learned to program, while matlab scripting at an internship, was to write a physics simulator that modeled elastic balls bouncing around under the effects of gravity.

                        <li>
                            In addition to the EvolutionSimulator above, I also built a <a href="https://github.com/danmane/CellSim">simulation</a> of how complex multicellular behavior can arise from many individually dumb and ignorant cells running instances of the same "DNA" program. At one point, a bug in the DNA caused a certain cell type to replicate out of control, growing into a cancerous tumor on the side of the organism!
