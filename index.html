    We on Earth have just awakened to the great oceans of space and time from which we have emerged. We are the legacy of fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution. We have a choice: We can enhance life and come to know the universe that made us, or we can squander our fifteen billion year heritage in meaningless self-destruction.

            <p>
                Plottable.js is a charting / data visualization library built on top of
                <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. It is <a href="http://www.palantir.com">Palantir</a>'s most prominent open-source project. It produces charts by combining small, modular components within a layout engine. Plottable is entirely in <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plottable is under active development by a team at Palantir, and is used in a variety of Palantir products. It is also one of the most-starred Typescript projects on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the tech lead on Plottable from Janurary 2014, when I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/palantir/plottable/commit/2854c7e61a816f457b1baef1e7bce60060777c00">first line of code</a> until November 2014, when I left Palantir. I was responsible for the architecture and many of the technical decisions. You can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A_FdbTkp9c">tech talk at JSConf EU</a> in which I describe the architecture and history of Plottable. Plottable was used to create the chart at the top of this page.

    </h3>
            <p>
                A web-based simulation of evolving bacteria-like organisms that simulates natural selection and evolution. Built as an art project using Processing.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                It uses web workers to run the simualtion model in a non-blocking fashion as a seperate process, and then passes model states to a renderer running on the main event loop. The front-end interpolates model updates so that even as the model slows down, the framerate remains constant. The blobs themselves have a simple genetic structure that encodes their properties and abilities, and a simple neural network that functions as an AI.

                    I'm quite interested by finance and economics.

                            At age 18, I was responsible for a $5mm investment by Moody's Treasury Department.

                        <li>
                            In college, I founded Phoenix Capital Partners, a student-run investment fund that raised over $20,000 from students and invested it with a 42% IRR on deployed capital.

                    I'm fascinated by building simulations of the world.
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>
                            The first thing I did when I learned to program, while matlab scripting at an internship, was to write a physics simulator that modeled elastic balls bouncing around under the effects of gravity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In addition to the EvolutionSimulator above, I also built a <a href="https://github.com/danmane/CellSim">simulation</a> of how complex multicellular behavior can arise from many individually dumb and ignorant cells running instances of the same "DNA" program. At one point, a bug in the DNA caused a certain cell type to replicate out of control, growing into a cancerous tumor on the side of the organism!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At some point, I hope to build a simulator of an ecosystem from which interesting high-level interactions, e.g. parasitism and predation, naturally emerge.

                        I've travelled extensively (over 45 countries); some memorable experiences include visiting a birthday party thrown by a Mayan family in a rural Guatemalan farming village, eating yak tongue while travelling across the Mongolian desert, and thumb-wrestling with monk children in Tibet.
